# Personal Data Logger

## Overview:

I made this project after reading the judgment chapter in the 10 equations for life. It also came from a kinda self help school.

- I resit work when
- I get de-energized when
- Love the work when
- I get energized when
- ~~I can talk all day about~~ i am cognizant of my passions
- Why do I do what i do
- Where might I thrive
- What environments are best for me

Now all these questions are quite big and I can attempt to answer those questions now but I feel I will be subject to my own hubris. Therefore what better way to understand myself with data. FAGMAN does it why can't I. I have already worked quite hard to protect my data from the FAGMAN but I am also a man who loves data science, math and programming; therefore I can do what FAGMAN does but on myself. Monitor the time I spend on what task, my emotions when doing, my hardware I am using, my software I am using... I will make a CLI tool to log my life and help me answer these questions.

The overall goal is to optamise my life and gain a deeper recognition for who I am using the only way people can actually know things.

The tools I want to use:
I want to use rust because I have never built a CLI tool in rust and I want to get deep into it.

I am thinking of hosting a db probs using free bsd on a surface go I won from a hackathon, it has 60GB of memory and 4GB of ram and I can't upgrade it cuz microsoft so might be a little struggle so I will try.
